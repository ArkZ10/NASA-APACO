## Project
Our project is called "MOUSETRONAUT", it is an interactive web-based educational comic that targeted middle until the general public audience to better understand the journey of becoming an astronaut. This project end goal is to improve the public knowledge on enlight the public on how important data from experiment being curated and leads to astronaut safety and create the mitigation and countermeasure before launching into space. The project will used Larry the mousetronaut as the mascot in becoming the first mouse astronaut after went through what human does. With data visualitation regarding spaceflight body changes and interactive branch stories, will make this website more entertaining yet educating for the general public in learning to put themselves in astronaut shoes. This multilateral approach will be suitable for all age graphic and our will delivered APACO message on the safety and precautions NASA astronaut have to go through and inspiring future astronaut about the pathway of preparing their believe in becoming the next generation space explorer.


## Repository Structure

This repository contains various resources and files for the MOUSETRONAUT. Below is an overview of the folders and their contents:

### `Dataset`
- **Purpose**: Holds all the raw data used for the analysis in this project.
- **Contents**: 
  - `GLDS-25_array_SampleTable_GLMicroArrayData.txt`: Sample table data related to the GLDS-25 array.
  - `GLDS-25_array_contrasts_GLMicroArrayData.txt`: Data on contrasts related to GLDS-25.
  - `GLDS-25_array_differential_expression_GLMicroArrayData.txt`: Differential expression data for the GLDS-25 array.
  - `multiqc_data_379.json`: MultiQC report data for dataset 379, used for quality control of sequencing results or similar metrics.
  - `multiqc_data_665.json`: MultiQC report data for dataset 665, similarly used for quality control metrics.

### `Data-Visualization`
